# Intro to React

## Tasks:
- [X] Display all tasks
- [X] Add a way to delete tasks
- [X] Make a way to add tasks
- [ ] `npm install`
- [ ] `npm start` to run this app on `localhost:3000`
- [ ] Explore this repo
- [ ] Break some stuff
- [ ] Fix it again

## Ideas for functionality to add (choose any):
- [ ] Put a line through the task when you click on it
- [ ] Display total number of tasks
- [ ] Display number of tasks left to complete
- [ ] Add due dates for each task
- [ ] Add colours if due date is near / far
- [ ] Ability to sort tasks by date / alphabetically...
- [ ] Put tasks into different categories

## Things to note:
- **NEVER MUTATE STATE**
- Use the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html), they are _amaaaazing_!
- Info on controlled components [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
- We don't need to use the constructor or bind methods, as used in the React docs.
- Don't worry about styling today. Try to play with the fundamental functionality of React.
